# Service Proxies

A service proxy is a network proxy that manages traffic into and out of a single service. Typically that service both accepts and makes requests, and all of this traffic goes through the service proxy. The service proxy protects the service by checking and verifying incoming requests, and it assists the service by routing outgoing requests, retrying them if necessary, and sometimes adding credentials.
