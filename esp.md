# ESP

ESP, the "Extensible Service Proxy", is the original proxy developed for [Cloud Endpoints](/cloud-endpoints).

ESP is a custom build of nginx with source available at [github.com/cloudendpoints/esp](https://github.com/cloudendpoints/esp).

Official container images are available at `gcr.io/endpoints-release/endpoints-runtime:1`.

[github.com/agentio/esp](https://github.com/agentio/esp) is a fork that includes a [Dockerfile](https://github.com/agentio/esp/blob/master/Dockerfile) and configuration to use GitHub actions to build alternate container images that are published at [github.com/agentio/esp/pkgs/container/esp](https://github.com/agentio/esp/pkgs/container/esp).
