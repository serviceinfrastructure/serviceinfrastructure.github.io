# Extensible Service Proxies

The Extensible Service Proxies run alongside API servers and are configured and controlled by [Service Infrastructure](/service-infrastructure).


There are two Google-supported versions of these proxies:
1. [ESP](/esp), a custom proxy based on nginx.
2. [ESPv2](/espv2), a custom proxy based on [Envoy](/envoy).
