This is an expanded discussion of [Managing gRPC APIs with Service Infrastructure and Envoy](https://timburks.me/2024/10/28/managing-grpc-apis).

It starts with a review of [API Management](/api-management) and an aside discussing what's special about [gRPC API Management](/grpc-api-management).

Then we look at Google's [Service Infrastructure](/service-infrastructure) and the [Extensible Service Proxies](/extensible-service-proxies).

[The q Tool](/the-q-tool) helps us configure and demonstrate Service Infrastructure-based API management.
