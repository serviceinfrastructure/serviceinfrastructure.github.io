# API Management

API management addresses common concerns that arise when developers make and use APIs.

For API producers, these concerns usually include:
* controlling who uses an API
* monitoring the usage and performance of an API

API consumers have similar concerns:
* using credentials to obtain access to an API
* monitoring the performance of APIs that they are using

These are ''common'' concerns because nearly all API producers and consumers have them. Developers often start by addressing these concerns in their service and client implementations, but soon they begin moving their solutions into libraries and frameworks, and eventually they turn to solutions outside of their code. Typically these external solutions run "out of process" and are part of the operating system or environment where the service or client runs.
